    <h2 id="history"> A Brief History</h2>
        <p> Canarsie is a neighborhood in the most southeastern park of Brooklyn that sits near Jamaica Bay. Once a fishing village in the 1800s, Canarsie quickly became
        more commericialzed as the fishing sources became slowly contaminated. Now, Canarsie is a middle-class neighborhood with strong West Indian influences.
        </p>
        
        <p> The word "Canarsie" comes from the Dutch term for the native Lenape word "Canarsee" which means "fenced land" or "fort." Now, if you ask local Brooklynites whether this term still
            applies, they would most likely reply with a resounding "yes" as Canarsie is rather difficult to get to. This stems from it's proximity to public transportation.

        <h3> Canarsie Pier</h3>
        
            <p> Seeing as Canarsie sits on Jamaica Bay, it's only appropriate for the neighborhood to have a pier! Canarsie Pier is a bustling location where  you can find numerous
            people fishing, flying kites, barbequing, and enjoying the sunsets at dusk. There are also kayaks and fishing equipment available for rent so that you can enjoy the pier
            to its fullest  extent.

        <h3> Parks, Parks, and More Parks!</h3>
        
            <p> Canarsie has a large number of parks, with the largest appropriately named Canarsie Park. Once a fairly small park, the park has undergone a large rehabilitation which

            enjoy.
