            <p>
                The UWS is known for its architecture and is frequently seen in TV and Movies; from West Side Story to You Got Mail and Seinfeld the UWS has been used as a setting. </p>
                <p>
                The UWS is a primarily residential area.  Much of the UWS was built in during the first half of 20th century which gives the neighborhood a Beaux-Arts and Art Deco look.  The Central Park West buildings are particularly iconic.
