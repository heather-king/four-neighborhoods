        <h1>A Brief History</h1>
         <p>St. George is the administrative center of Staten Island, and also serves as the visitor's 
        introduction to Staten Island. However, it is not the oldest or most historic neigborhood. Its
        history is fairly recent.
        </p>
        
        <p>While it has always been difficult for St. George to feel itself a part of New York City, the
        local planners have found some new ways to integrate it. There are several large construction 
        projects underway which will bring new visitors and residents to the area. They includ a large
        outlet mall, baseball stadium, ferris wheel and lighthouse museum clustered around the Staten Island
        Ferry Terminal.
        </p>

   <div id="demographics"> 
        <h1>Demographics</h1>
        <p> The modern day community of St. George grew up around the Quarantine Station. It included the people 
        who worked at the station and those people who had relatives interned there. There were many Irish immigrants
        interned in the Quarantine Station and thus the community developed a large Irish component, 
        centered around St. Peters Church. As the community has grown many other people have arrived and 
        it is now quite diverse. </p>

        <h1>Points of Interest</h1>
        <h3>Staten Island Ferry </h3>
        
            <p> The first thing that people think of when they hear the name Staten Island, is the world famous
            ferry. It attracts a huge number of tourists every year. However, until now, nearly all of those tourists
            would arrive in St. George and immediately turn around and head back to Manhattan. The opening of new 
            attractions, now at various stages of completion, is meant to change all that.</p>
                    
        <h3> Borough Hall and Hyatt Street</h3>
            <p> The first building that most people see upon exiting the Ferry building, is Staten
            Island's historic Borough Hall. Built in 1906 in the beaux-artes style, it was designed by
            the architectural firm Carrere and Hastings.
            <br>
            Behind Borough Hall is Hyatt Street, which ascends steeply up from there. Along this,
            the main street of St. George are the St. George Theater and the new courthouse, completed
            in 2014.</p>
            
        <h3> Lighthouse Museum </h3>
            <p> A recently completed component of the new waterfront is the Lighthouse Museum, which
            stands at the shoreline to the east of the Ferry Terminal. 
            <br>
            It will soon be complimented by the Lighthouse Point project, which includes 
            a hotel, restaurants and residential development. Phase One of that project is already
            under construction and appears as a large hole in the ground for now.  
            </p>
            
        <h3> The Baseball Stadium</h3>
            <p> The first project to be completed in the new waterfront area is the baseball stadium which
            hosts the New York Yankees single A affiliate team, the Staten Island Yankees. It opened in 2002 
            and there were high hopes that it would lead to an upturn in the economics of St. George. However, it 
            wasn't really enough, in itself, to positively impact the local economy. St. George needed bigger
            things, and now, hopefully, it has got them.
